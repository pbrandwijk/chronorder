Requirements:

- Unix-like operating system (tested with Ubuntu)
- Glasgow Haskell Compiler (tested with version 7.0.3)
- GNU Make (tested with version 3.81)

Instructions:

Open a terminal and change to the directory containing 
the source files of chronorder. Execute the following 
command:

$ make install

This compiles the chronorder executable and compresses the man page. The executable is then installed in /usr/bin and the man page in /usr/share/man/man1. If you want to install into different locations, then first open the Makefile and change the BIN and MAN variables before issueing the make install command.

The program is now installed and available on your path.

Lastly clean up the source directory using:

$ make clean

This concludes the installation of chronorder.
