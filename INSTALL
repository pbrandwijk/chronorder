Requirements:

- Unix-like operating system (tested with Ubuntu)
- Glasgow Haskell Compiler (tested with version 7.0.3)
- GNU Make (tested with version 3.81)

Instructions:

Open a terminal and change to the directory containing 
the source files of chronorder. Execute the following 
command:

$ make chronorder

The chronorder executable is now being build and the 
man pages are compressed.

Now move the executable to a convenient place. For example:

$ sudo mv chronorder /usr/bin/

Now move the man pages to their standard location so they
can be found:

$ sudo mv man1/chronorder.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1/

Lastly clean up the source directory using:

$ make clean

The program chronorder can now be used.
